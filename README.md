# Woof-d-Quacks
Goofy name but just a social media platform for friend groups structured in a peer-to-peer system. DMs can be peer to peer or connected to the database, while all posts and group chats will be using the database (for now atleast to keep things simple). All calls are through peer to peer communication.
